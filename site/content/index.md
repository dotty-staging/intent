Intent is a test framework for [Dotty](https://dotty.epfl.ch) (which is expected to become Scala 3 in year 2020).

Intent is designed to give you clear and concise tests by focusing on:

* Low cermony test code
* Uniform test declaration
* Futures and async testing
* Arranging test state
* Fast to run tests
